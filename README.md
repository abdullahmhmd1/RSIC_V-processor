# RSIC_V-processor
This project implements a single-cycle RISC-V processor capable of executing a subset of instructions. It includes components like the ALU, control unit, register file, memory units, and PC. Each instruction is fetched, decoded, and executed in one clock cycle, demonstrating core CPU functionality.
